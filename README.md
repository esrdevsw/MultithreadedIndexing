 Multi-threaded Indexing

In this menu-driven program, we use a simple command line user interface where the
user must enter three files to run (A text file to parse, a dictionary, and a stop word list). After
entering these files, it will be possible to build a report with the result of the correlation between
the files. To avoid exceptions, we implement a try-catch block for each user input.
To process and parse the text, we use virtual threads in preview mode. We use
AtomicInteger as a counter to ensure the best functioning of virtual threads. On the FileTextImpl
class, when we call ProcessParseFile class we implement a catch to handle the
UnsupportedOperationException and show the instruction to enable the preview with the
return message:
[INFO] try Run with
java --enable-preview -cp ./indexer.jar ie.atu.sw.Runner
The application is run using the Runner Class. It accomplishes this by starting the
APIMenu Class. That class shows a menu and calls all the classes required to run and configure
the API.
The APIMenu class display a menu with six different options:
1) Specify Text File - gives the user the option of inserting the text file which is
then sent to the ProcessParseFile Class.
2) Configure Dictionary - gives the user the option of inserting the Dictionary
or using the default value.
3) Configure Common Words â€“ The user can insert a file with a StopWords List
or use the default value.
4) Specify Output File - give the user the option to specify the file to output or
use the default value "index.txt".
5) Execute - This option calls the BuildWordIndex class to process the files and
generate the report and displays a short summary on the screen with
6) Quit - End the program
